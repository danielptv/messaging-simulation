# Messaging Simulation

## About

This project is a simulation for messaging consisting of 3 main parts:

* **Apache Kafka** as message-oriented middleware (MOM) and distributed messaging system.
* **Producers** produce messages (orders) and send them to the queue.
* **Consumers** consume the orders from the queue and send confirmation messages back to the producers. Each consumer
  can process exactly one type of order. The confirmations are being sent
  by RESTful calls.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

To run this simulation you will need the following software:

* Installation of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* JDK min. version 19,
  i.e. [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=19)
* Recent version of [Gradle](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/) to create Docker images and use Gradle CLI
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you don't want to manually download the
  project

### How To Run (build Docker images)

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/danielptv/messaging-simulation.git`
2. Create Docker images of **consumer** and **producer** by running `gradle bootBuildImage` in their respective root
   directories.
3. Start the servers by calling `docker compose up` in the projects' root directory using the provided <code>
   *docker-compose.yaml*</code>.
4. Done!

**Note:** Producer and Kafka ports as well as consumer types can be adjusted in the <code>*.env*</code> file.

### How To Run (use Gradle developer mode)

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/danielptv/messaging-simulation.git`
2. Start Kafka by calling `docker compose up zookeeper kafka` in the projects' root directory using the provided <code>*docker-compose.yaml*</code>.
3. Start consumers and producers by running `gradle bootRun` repeatedly in their respective root
   directories. **Important:** Make sure to specify ports by passing them as options to avoid conflicts. For consumers,
   also define their type as it will default to *"software"* otherwise.

Below examples show how to start a producer and a consumer server with `gradle bootRun`:

````shell
cd /messaging-simulation/producer
gradle bootRun -Dport=8082
````

````shell
cd /messaging-simulation/consumer
gradle bootRun -Dport=8086 -Dtype=hardware
````

### How To Simulate

#### Basic Scenario (all servers running)

Once you have the project up and running, simulating the messaging is quite easy. You can use the built-in IntelliJ HTTP
Client or any other tool like Postman to place orders (aka send messages).

For the IntelliJ HTTP Client you can find a predefined set of messages in the <code>*POST-orders.http*</code> file that
you can run out of the box. **Important:** Adjust the ports in <code>*http-client.env.json*</code> to the ones you have
set when starting up the servers.

Now you are ready to start sending out messages. Every time a message is sent out or processed the respective server
will log it. Watch the logs carefully!

#### Advanced Scenarios

To test out more advanced scenarios like the consumer being unavailable and Kafka therefore queuing up messages you can
shut down and start the servers selectively.

If your servers are Docker images (the first running option described
above) use `docker compose stop <container_name>` to stop and `docker compose up <container_name>` to start a server.
Otherwise, stop your servers with the CTRL+C shortcut.

Once again, you can now send messages and see what will happen. Happy simulating!

## Implementation and Structure

The project consists of the two microservices 'consumer' and 'producer' as well as Apache Kafka as message-oriented
middleware.
The microservices are both implemented as Spring Boot applications. Below you can find explanations of some of their
main aspects in terms of structure and implementation.

To ensure code quality, the code can be linted using `gradle spotbugsmain checkstylemain`.

**Apache Kafka** ─ Distributed messaging system.

Kafka is configured in the <code>
*docker-compose.yaml*</code> using the confluentinc/cp-kafka image (Kafka Community Edition).

**Producer** ─ Sends messages to the queue and receives confirmations from consumers.

````text
producer/src
 └── main
      ├── java/com.acme
      │     ├── rest/Controller.java
      │     ├── rest/Service.java
      │     └── Application.java
      └── resources/application.yml
````

* **Controller.java:** Implements a simple REST endpoint for receiving confirmations and triggering orders.
* **Service.java:** Sends order messages using Kafka. The methods are called by the controller.
* **application.yml:** Configuration for spring-kafka and other important parameters.

**Consumer** ─ Receives messages from the queue and sends back confirmations to the respective producers.

````text
consumer/src
 └── main
      ├── java/com.danielptv
      │     ├── dev/CustomErrorHandler.java
      │     ├── kafka/OrderConsumer.java
      │     ├── rest/ConfirmationController.java
      │     └── Application.java
      └── resources/application.yml
````

* **OrderConsumer.java:** Implements a Kafka message listener (@KafkaListener) to receive messages from the queue. If
  the order type matches the consumer type the message will be processed and a confirmation will be sent by calling the
  ConfirmationController.
* **ConfirmationController.java:** Sends confirmation messages upon call. The confirmations are sent as POST request to
  the API endpoint of the producer corresponding to the passed order. The correct endpoint must be provided by the
  order-message.
* **CustomErrorHandler.java:** Provides custom error handling for exceptions thrown within the Kafka listener.
* **application.yml:** Configuration for spring-kafka and other important parameters. Parameterization enables this
  server to be a generic consumer with the consumer type being passed through an environment variable.

## Test Cases

### Scenario: Kafka, producers and consumers are running
**Setup:**
* Start Kafka with `docker compose up zookeeper kafka`
* Start producers and consumers with `docker compose up consumer-1 consumer-2 producer-1 producer-2`
* Send messages (orders)

**Result:**
* All orders are processed directly by the consumer responsible for the respective order type
* Order confirmations are sent out immediately
* Order confirmations are successfully received by the right producers

### Scenario: Producer sends message of type that can't be processed
**Setup:**
* Start Kafka with `docker compose up zookeeper kafka`
* Start producers and consumers with `docker compose up consumer-1 consumer-2 producer-1 producer-2`
* Send order of an order type that doesn't match any consumer type. In the example consumers of type 'software' and 'hardware' exist while that message has the order type 'cookies'

**Results:**
* The message is sent successfully by the producers
* Nothing happens afterwards as there is no consumer to process this type of message. Therefore, the producer will never receive a confirmation for this message.

### Scenario: Consumer receive messages delayed as they are down at first
**Setuo:**
* Start Kafka with `docker compose up zookeeper kafka`
* Start producers with `docker compose up producer-1 producer-2` (Do not start consumers yet)
* Send messages
* Start consumers with `docker compose up consumer-1 consumer-2`

**Results:**
* The messages are sent successfully. However, the messages are not received as the addressed consumers are down. The messages instead reside in the queue inside Kafka
* Once the consumers are started they receive the messages, process them and send out confirmations
* The confirmations are received by the producers (There is a delay due to the consumers being down at first of course)

### Scenerio: Producer unable to receive confirmation due to unavilability
**Setup:**
* Start Kafka with `docker compose up zookeeper kafka`
* Start a producer of your choice, for example `docker compose up producer-1`
* Send a message with an order type matching the consumer you want to start later
* Stop the producer you've started earlier by calling for example `docker compose stop producer-1`
* Start the consumer you have sent a message to, for example `docker compose up consumer-2`

**Results:**
* The message is sent out successfully
* Once the consumer is running it receives the message and tries to send a confirmation
* The confirmation sending fails as the receiving producer has become unavailable meanwhile (RessourceAccessException). Since this simulation uses REST for sending confirmations the confirmation is lost in this case

### Scenario: Temporary unavailability of Kafka
**Setup:**
* Start Kafka with `docker compose up zookeeper kafka`
* Start a producer of your choice, for example `docker compose up producer-1`
* Send a message with an order type matching the consumer you want to start later
* Stop Kafka with `docker compose stop zookeeper kafka`
* Start Kafka with `docker compose up zookeeper kafka`
* Start the consumer you have sent a message to, for example `docker compose up consumer-2`

**Results:**
* Although Kafka was stopped temporarily it is configured by default to persist messages currently in the queue on shutdown. Therefore the message is successfully delivered to the recipient and the producer receives the confirmation. The persistance can be turned off if the use case does not require as it can reduce the overall performance of Kafka

### Scenario: Kafka is down
**Setup:**
* Start a producer of your choice, for example `docker compose up producer-1`
* Start a consumer of your choice, for example `docker compose up consumer-2`
* Stop Kafka with `docker compose stop zookeeper kafka` (Docker Compose automatically starts Kafka because consumers and producers depend on its health check)
* Send a message

**Result:**
* The message cannot be sent as Kafka is down. An exception is thrown when the message is sent
* The consumers network client cannot connect to Kafka and also fails with an exception
* **Note:** The exception are left unhandeled intentionally for demonstration purposes
